# task1
In the previous three created programs, we have :
- The first program; the complexity is O(n), because we have one While loop which runs 'n' times.
- The second program; the complexity is O(n^2), because we have two while loops, which run 'n*n' times.
- The third program; the complexity is O(n^3), because we have three While loops, which run 'n*n*n' times.
